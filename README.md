Abraham Tenorio
B.S. Electrical Engineering
Blacksburg, VA, USA

	Abraham is the Director of Electronics and Innovation. As the sole Electronics and Communication Engineering (ECE) major among the group, Abraham champions the integration of cutting-edge electronic solutions into the GobbleBot’s architecture. His expertise lies in bridging the realms of hardware and software, guiding the team through the intricacies of electronic system development. He is responsible for the front end integration of our sensors writing arduino code to collect raw data from our GPS module, Magnetometer, and Lidar. He is also highly proficient in CAD responsible for the housing for sensors, food storage compartment locking mechanism, and version 1s design. He currently works in Applied Electromagnetics and wishes to further explore this field.

Abdullah Khurram
B.S. Computer Science
Blacksburg, VA, USA

	Abdullah is the lead programmer for the team. As the sole dedicated software engineer for the team, he is responsible for software development and continuous integration/implementation for the robot. As the programmer, he has created various tools and scripts that help further the development of the GobbleBot. He wishes one day to help push computer technology forward, via AI or quantum computing or low-level systems development. Whatever it may be, he is talented, passionate, and is looking forward to joining the tech community. 

Robert Higinbotham
B.S. Aerospace Engineering
Blacksburg, VA, USA

	Robert is the lead engineer for the mechanical design and structural analysis of the GobbleBot. His work over the 2023 Fall semester includes the design and simulation of the drivetrain elements and suspension system incorporating the anticipated stresses and conditions that the robot will likely encounter. He has also led efforts as the primary outreach for the team, contacting on campus partners as well as promoting the integration of GobbleBot with Virginia Tech Dining Services. Furthermore, he has acted as the team's code integration lead, using previous experience with Python to aid in the realization of the codebase to fit the team's needs. Ultimately, Robert plans to utilize the trans-disciplinary skills he has developed to lead growth in the space manufacturing industry.

Elijah Hinton
B.S. Aerospace Engineering
Blacksburg, VA, USA

	Elijah is a passionate and fast learner, always eager to try and learn new things, to contribute in any way that he can. This mindset has caused him to become a sort of catch-all for the team, while each of the other members have their specific roles, Elijah fills in all the gaps. He wishes to one day contribute to the aerospace industry, whether it be space, planes, or whatever niche he may one day fill.

## Current Status
IN PROGRESS

## Project Overview

The Gobble Bot: Food Delivery project is based upon the desire to provide the students on campus a hassle-free option to get food delivered from the dining facilities directly to their dorms for mobility limited students or those that desire the convenience. This will aid in less students in the dining facilities, crowding and overwhelming staff while also allowing for more economic opportunity by expanding the potential consumerbase to the students who want food delivered.
We believe this project is feasible as we have created a prototype previously that demonstrated the conceptual practicality of our goals and similar implementations are found at other campuses such as GMU and JMU demonstrating that the technology is available and a demand for these services exists. Our approach should be competitive with these alternatives as we will be able to offer the service at a much lower price to the campus as we are our own labor, are not solely driven through profit motivation and are VT based which is attractive for our potential on campus investors.
Our endeavors are sustainable as well as we can quickly create more robots as demand
requires due to our small scale manufacturing approach being easily expanded at scale by using simple materials and additive manufacturing that is easy to scale. Furthermore, we can adapt our pathfinding to new dorm and dining construction as well by utilizing open source map data making it resilient for the foreseeable future. There is also a link between its desirability and sustainability as students desiring to have food delivered is not likely to change for the long term and therefore makes the project attractive in the long term.
Also, there is a link proven link between the feasibility and viability of this project as we have proven that we were able to make a prototype using the technology available to us
on a highly restricted budget which proves that we should be able to create a cheaper and therefore competitive alternative to the similar robotic delivery provided at other campuses.
